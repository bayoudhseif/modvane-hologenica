## ✦ Features

### Entity Cloning System
Clone any living entity using neural technology and modular Neurolink networks.

**The Imprinter** scans living entities standing on it, capturing their genetic data and imprinting it into empty Bioscanners. Place an entity on the Imprinter and watch as it performs a detailed scan with particle effects. Players will be left at 1 heart after scanning, while mobs are consumed in the process.

**The Neurocell** is your cloning pod. Insert a Bioscanner with captured DNA and it displays a holographic preview of the entity being cloned. The back of the Neurocell connects to other machines through Neurolink cables, creating a modular network.

**The Reformer** grows clones from 1% to 100% maturity. Connect it to a Neurocell containing a cloned entity, and watch as the clone materializes with a progress indicator. Once complete, the fully-grown entity spawns into the world.

**Neurolink Cables** connect like redstone but exclusively for Hologenica machines. Build unlimited range networks across your base. Connect multiple Imprinters and Reformers to a single Neurocell, or chain setups together for industrial-scale cloning operations.

### Holographic Terrain Mapping
Visualize your surroundings with stunning 3D holographic projections that float above the projector block.

**The Hologram Projector** automatically scans nearby terrain and displays a rotating 3D hologram above the block. Configure scan size (32x, 64x, 128x), block rendering size, transparency, rotation, and rendering style (Classic or Realistic) through the GUI. Perfect for planning builds or exploring cave systems.

### Cross-Dimensional Teleportation
Travel instantly between any two points using telepads.

**Telepads** link through matching names. Place two telepads anywhere (even across dimensions) and give them the same name to connect them. Stand on either pad, wait for the charge-up, and teleport instantly. Create fast travel networks across all dimensions without coordinates or complex menus.

## ✦ How To Use

<details>
<summary><b>Cloning Entities</b></summary>

**Step 1: Setup the System**

Place a Neurocell and connect an Imprinter to it using Neurolink cables. The Neurolink must connect to the back of the Neurocell.

**Step 2: Insert Bioscanner**

Place an empty Bioscanner into the Neurocell.

**Step 3: Capture DNA**

Stand on the Imprinter (or lure an entity onto it). The Imprinter will automatically scan and imprint the DNA into the Bioscanner in the connected Neurocell. Players will be left at 1 heart, mobs will be killed.

**Step 4: Wait for Clone**

The Neurocell will display a holographic preview of the entity being cloned.

**Step 5: Grow and Spawn**

Connect a Reformer to the Neurocell using Neurolink cables. The Reformer will grow the clone from 1% to 100% and then spawn it as a real entity.

<details>
<summary><b>Using Telepads</b></summary>

**Step 1: Place Telepads**

Place telepads at your desired locations.

**Step 2: Name Your Telepads**

Right-click each telepad and give it a unique name.

**Step 3: Link Telepads**

Give both telepads the same name to link them together.

**Step 4: Teleport**

Stand on either telepad and wait for it to charge up, then you'll be teleported to the other location.

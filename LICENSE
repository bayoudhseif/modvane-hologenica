1. Definitions and Ownership

1.1 The "Mod" refers to any software, code, assets, design, or documentation distributed under this license by the original author ("the Author").

1.2 The Mod is the exclusive property of the Author. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by the Author.

1.3 “Distribute” refers to any form of sharing, publishing, uploading, or transferring the Mod, whether publicly or privately, via any digital or physical medium, including but not limited to websites, mod platforms, file hosts, peer-to-peer networks, or direct transmission.

1.4 “Monetize” refers to generating direct income, revenue, or other material benefit from access to, distribution of, or interaction with the Mod itself. This excludes indirect revenue such as ad-supported videos, livestreams, or modpacks that do not individually sell or restrict access to the Mod.

1.5 This license applies across all methods of use, distribution, or storage, including present and future technologies or platforms, whether online or offline.

2. Granted Permissions

You may generate revenue through platforms such as YouTube, Twitch, or others. You do not need to request permission for this type of use, as long as the Mod itself is not being sold or monetized directly.

- 2.3.1 The Mod must remain unmodified.
- 2.3.2 The Mod must not be sold or monetized as a standalone product.
- 2.3.3 Reasonable credit must be maintained, such as preserving the Mod’s original filename, metadata, or manifest entries that identify the Author. Explicit public attribution (e.g., in a modpack description) is not required.

2.4 Private Sharing
You may privately share the Mod in its original, unmodified form with individuals (e.g., friends or collaborators) provided:
- 2.4.1 No payment or compensation is exchanged.
- 2.4.2 The Mod is not made publicly accessible via public file hosts or mod repositories.

3. Prohibited Actions

3.1 Commercial Sale and Redistribution
You may not sell, license, rent, or otherwise monetize the Mod directly, whether alone or bundled.

3.3 Modification and Redistribution
You may not modify, fork, or distribute altered versions of the Mod without written permission from the Author.

You may not charge for access to the Mod or distribute it through a paywalled, gated, or tokenized (e.g., NFT-based) system.

4. Disclaimer of Warranty

4.1 The Mod is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. The Author is not liable for any damages, losses, or issues resulting from the use or misuse of the Mod.

5. Termination

5.1 Any violation of this license results in immediate termination of all granted rights.
